I restarted my blog, on the ruby-world's famous blogging engine: Jekyll. The latest hasn't got _real_ english section,
just an about page, so, now I try to step forward.

<!--more-->

Jekyll makes my blogging workflow much easier then it was with the Wordpress ever. Plus I also want to share my ideas,
my experiments' result also in english, so, I hope, You'll see here english language contents more often.
Not all articles will be translated, because, e.g. about Jekyll you can read a lot of things on the web, but not so much
on hungarian language, but I think I can share some interesting thing about application development.
